## Case Study Summary

Designing an approachable, patient-first ongoing medical care management app concept. The app focuses on ongoing treatments, managing appointments, tests and medical information management. After completing the design challenge, I submitted my design to prompts.io to receive feedback.

### Design Process

1. Design and problem exploration
2. User research
3. Brand exploration
4. Component design and layout
5. Visual polish and composition

### Project Lessons and Reflections

1. My initial design process helped uncover useful product insights. But, once I started designing in Figma I didn't refer back to those insights nearly enough!
2. I didn't do enough user research for such a complicated product area. I did background and competitor research but further research is essential.
3. The visual design and branding can be refined. Starting from the Apple HIG gave the app a solid foundation. More refinement is needed on the information-heavy screens, such as search-centre and records.

## Design Exploration and Initial Discovery

### Design Process and Problem Exploration

![The messy handwritten design process I started with, spanning 7-pages of design process templates.](~/assets/images/med-care-app/process.png)
I won't subject you to reading my messy handwriting, circular thought process and broad exploration. Suffice to say, the circled elements on the bottom right represent the key functions that need to be fulfiled. (If you really want the details, hear's the [Process PDF.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/munwa5gzpiqpmt5/Design_Process_Prompts.pdf?dl=0))

### Brand Exploration

### Exploring Human Interface Guideline Components
